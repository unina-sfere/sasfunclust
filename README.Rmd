# sasfunclust

The package  sasfunclust implements the the sparse and smooth functional clustering (SaS-Funclust) method proposed by Centofanti et al. 2021.
SaS-Funclust is a new method for clustering functional data that aims to classify a sample of curves into homogeneous groups while jointly detecting the most informative portions of domain.
The mothod relies on a general functional Gaussian mixture model whose parameters are estimated by maximizing a log-likelihood function penalized with the functional adaptive pairwise fusion penalty and a roughness penalty.
## Installation

You can install the released version of sasfunclust from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("sasfunclust")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fabiocentofanti/sasfunclust")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(sasfunclust)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}

```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}

```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
